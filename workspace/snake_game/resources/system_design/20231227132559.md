## Implementation approach

We will use Python's built-in libraries like tkinter for GUI, and sqlite3 for storing leaderboard data. The game logic will be implemented in a separate module. We will use object-oriented programming principles to create classes for the Snake, Food, and Leaderboard. The game will be event-driven, with the main event loop in the main module.

## File list

- main.py
- game.py
- snake.py
- food.py
- leaderboard.py

## Data structures and interfaces

    class Main {
        -Game game
        +main() str
    }
    class Game {
        -Snake snake
        -Food food
        -Leaderboard leaderboard
        +start_game() str
        +end_game() str
    }
    class Snake {
        +move() str
        +eat() str
    }
    class Food {
        +generate_food() str
    }
    class Leaderboard {
        +update_leaderboard() str
        +display_leaderboard() str
    }
    Main --> Game
    Game --> Snake
    Game --> Food
    Game --> Leaderboard

## Program call flow

    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    participant L as Leaderboard
    M->>G: start_game()
    G->>S: move()
    G->>F: generate_food()
    G->>S: eat()
    G->>L: update_leaderboard()
    G->>L: display_leaderboard()
    G->>M: end_game()

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specific mechanics of the snake game, such as the behavior of the snake when it eats food, and the scoring system.
